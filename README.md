# SwiftVG
## Purpose
If you need to display SVG files in your iOS application you don't have a ton of options.  The native support just isn't there and PaintCode is wonderful but has limitations:

+ complex SVGs generate a lot of code - and that much code can slow XCode way down.
+ The code generated by PaintCode has to be included in your app at compile time - no over the air SVGs.

Looking around the web I was able to find a couple great projects but nothing that did exactly what I wanted.  SVGKit was heavy and didn't let me draw directly to the context.  SKUBezierPath+SVG does a great job translating SVG paths to UIBezierPaths but doesn't help with parsing a large SVG file.

I built SwiftVG to make displaying SVG files in your iOS app easier - whether you bundle them with the application or deliver them over the air.

## Installation

I'll get to work on a cocoapod soon.  In the meantime just download the files and add them to your project.  You'll need an objective-c bridging header for [SKUBezierPath+SVG](https://github.com/ap4y/UIBezierPath-SVG) (included) which handles the path parsing.  I'm working on a Swift port inspired by SKUBezierPath+SVG to get rid of this dependency.

## Usage

Use `SVGVectorImage` where you would normally use `UIImage` and use `SVGView` where you would normally use `UIImageView`.

### Programmatically

    let svgView = SVGView(vectorImage:SVGVectorImage(named: "example"))
    view.addSubview(svgView)

### In A Storyboard

+ Drag a UIView out into the storyboard and change it's class to SVGView in the Identity Inspector
+ Optionally set an SVG Name - this is a file name in your main bundle (excluding the .svg)
+ The storyboard will live render your SVG, just like an UIImageView would!

### What if my SVG isn't in the bundle?

Instantiate our SVGVectorImage from NSData or a file path that could point anywhere.

    //load from data
    let data:NSData = /* data from somewhere - maybe the internet? */
    let svgVectorImage = SVGVectorImage(data: data)

    //load from a path
    let path = /* some path - maybe documents or tmp directory? */
    let svgVectorImage = SVGVectorImage(path: path)

    //however you end up with an SVGVectorImage you can add it to a SVGView to display it
    let svgView = SVGView() //could be on a storyboard - or created earlier
    svgView.vectorImage = svgVectorImage

### What's supported - What isn't?

SVGView supports the following contentMode values:
+ `.ScaleAspectFill`
+ `.ScaleAspectFit`
+ `.ScaleToFill`
+ `.Center`

I haven't tested every SVG out there so I'm sure there are things that I'm not supporting.  I currently support `groups`, `paths`, `polygons`, `rects`, `linearGradients`, and `radialGradients`.  This tends to work well for me on SVGs exported from Adobe Illustrator as per my workflow - but if you have a problematic SVG file let me know about it - or even better fix it and submit a pull request :)
